      Depending on your browser and the website sometimes you can look at the HTML source code of
      a web page. This will let you see some of the features that you want to emulate.

      For example I got the syantax for the links that I use on this website from one of my Professor's web pages.

      You can also simply look up wha you want since there are many online resources on HTML.
