      The Issue I decided to focus on was how to make a GitHub Website.
       This is because I am unfamiliar with this so documenting it would be a good idea.

       <br>
First in your text editor of choice create a file "index.html". 
This will serve as the home page.
To create more pages create some other files with the convention "name.html". 

Now go to the file of the page that you want to make first. 
Now add the HTML tags to the file.

<br>

Now in the file the text you type will be shown on the webpage you will make.
To change the way it is presented you can use different tags like tags that make the text bold.






       <br>

  The next step is to log in to GitHub and make a new repository.
   You can name it whatever you want but there are naming conventions.

  After you create it under the Quickstart options there should be an Add File option.

  Click on that and then click on upload file. You should then upload the files that you made web pages for.

  <br>

  Now go to the repository setiings

  Scroll down until you see the GitHub Pages section of the settings.
   Click on the publsishing source and select main. Then select root.

  Then select save.

  Then open the settings again and near the top of the GitHub Pages section there will be a link.
   This is the link to the website that you just created. 
   <br>


 


  Also one way to see what to do is by right clicking on a web page.
  Ceertain websites allow you to see the html source code
