      The Issue I decided to focus on was how to make a GitHub Website.
       This is because I am unfamiliar with this so documenting it would be a good idea.

  The first step is to log in to GitHub and make a new repository.
   You can name it whatever you want but there are naming conventions.

  After you create it under the Quickstart options there should be an Add File option.

  Click on that and then click on create new file. Name the file index.html



  Now go to the repository setiings

  Scroll down until you see the GitHub Pages section of the settings.
   Click on the publsishing source and select main. Then select root.

  Then select save.

  Then open the settings again and near the top of the GitHub Pages section there will be a link.
   This is the link to the website that you just created. Here is a link to mine.
    As you can clearly see it is very bare bones and not like the webpage you are reading right now.

  That is because in the same GitHub Pages setting there is an option to choose a theme.
   By selecting a theme a page will automatically be created that you can edit to add in what you want.

  This gives a great resource for sprucing up the website.

  Also it is important to know that it can be a bit laggy at times
  so sometimes the changes you make will not be reflected immediately.



  Also one way to see what to do is by right clicking on a web page.
  Ceertain websites allow you to see the html source code
