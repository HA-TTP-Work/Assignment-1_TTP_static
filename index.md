## Welcome to GitHub Pages

The Issue I decided to focus on was how to make a GitHub Website. This is because I am unfamiliar with this so documenting it would be a good idea.

The first step is to log in to GitHub and make a new repository.
You can name it whatever you want but there are naming conventions.

After you create it under the Quickstart options there should be an Add File option.

Click on that and then click on create new file.
Name the file index.html

Then write enclosed in "<h1>" tage something
It can be anything
Then commit the changes
	
Now go to the repository setiings 

Scroll down until you see the GitHub Pages section of the settings.
Click on the publsishing source and select main.
Then select root.

Then select save.

Then open the settings again and near the top of the GitHub Pages section there will be a link.
This is the link to the website that you just created.
Here is a link to mine.
As you can clearly see it is very bare bones and not like the webpage you are reading right now.

That is because in the same GitHub Pages setting there is an option to choose a theme.
By selecting a theme a page will automatically be created that you can edit to add in what you want.

This gives a great resource for sprucing up the website.

  
  
 

  
  

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/HA-TTP-Work/Assignment-1_TTP_static/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

This is a test to see if things will change.


### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/HA-TTP-Work/Assignment-1_TTP_static/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
